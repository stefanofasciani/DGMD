The DGMD (Dataset Generator for Musical Devices) is a collection of MAX patches and JavaScript files for the generation of datasets from hardware and software and musical devices.

There are two version of the DGMD:
* for Audio Effects
* for Sound Synthesizers

The folder Utilities contains a project for the electromechanical control of manual parameters via MIDI CC.

The DGMD requires [Cyclyng'74 Max](https://cycling74.com/products/max). To use the DGMD you do not need a Max license.
