# DGMD - Dataset Generator for Musical Devices

The DGMD (Dataset Generator for Musical Devices) is a collection of MAX patches and JavaScript files for the generation of datasets from hardware and software and musical devices.

There are two version of the DGMD:
* for Audio Effects
* for Sound Synthesizers

The folder Utilities contains a project for the electromechanical control of manual parameters via MIDI CC.

The DGMD is cross-platform and implemented in [Cyclyng'74 Max](https://cycling74.com/products/max) and Javascript.

To run the DGMD, open the *.maxpat* file in the respective subfolder or download the standalone applications for Windows or Max OSX from the [releases](https://github.com/stefanofasciani/DGMD/releases/) section.
